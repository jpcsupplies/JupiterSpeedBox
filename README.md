# JupiterSpeedBox
Space Engineers Skybox of jupiter with altered/tweaked ship speed settings

Workshop link: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=441062730


Skybox currently works under DirectX 9 + 11 mode of space engineers

Altered ship speed works under any DirectX mode - but is restricted by server sim speed (out of my control)

Fog is also disabled.  For Aesthetics this may change in future.


Small ship speed is (approx moon escape velocity) - 2580ms

Large ship speed - 1500ms


Angular/Rotational speed limits have also been increased to reduce likelyhood of rotors breaking:

 SmallShipMaxAngularSpeed 390

 LargeShipMaxAngularSpeed 385
