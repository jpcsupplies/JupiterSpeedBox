Space Engineers Skybox of jupiter with altered/tweaked ship speed settings

Workshop link: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=441062730


Skybox currently only works under DirectX 9 mode of space engineers

Altered ship speed works under any DirectX mode.

Fog is also disabled.  For Aesthetics this may change in future.


Small ship speed is approx moon escape velocity - 2380ms

Large ship speed is just below speed which pistons or rotors tend to break - 800ms


Angular/Rotational speed limits have also been increased to reduce likelyhood of rotors breaking:

 SmallShipMaxAngularSpeed 360

 LargeShipMaxAngularSpeed 380
